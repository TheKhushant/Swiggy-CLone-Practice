# 🍔 Swiggy Clone – Full Stack Food Delivery Web App

A fully functional Swiggy-like food delivery web application built using **React JS**, **Tailwind CSS**, and a **custom-built API**. The application simulates restaurant browsing, item selection, cart functionality, and dynamic routing – just like the real Swiggy experience.
